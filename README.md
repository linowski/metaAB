# metaAB
A meta-analysis calculator for combining two or more a/b tests together.

## Use Cases
- For making better decisions with aggregate data from retests or tests deemed similar enough
- For more accurate estimates of future experiments
- To enable decisions if you don't have enough statistical power to run your own experiments

## Credits & Thanks

- [Ryan Thomas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryancharlesthomas/) for finding that the initial p-values were not being properlly calculating upon the initial release. :)

## Working Preview
